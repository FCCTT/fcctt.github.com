Welcome to the first issue of Full Circle for 2012!

Happy new year! I hope all of you had a great holiday season and that you're ready for more Full Circle. This month we have an article on Enlightenment17 (aka: E17) and which distros have, and had, E17. I haven't tried it in quite some time, but I'm tempted to install Bodhi on my laptop. Oh, and Greg is hoping to return next month with his Python articles. He's a bit busy with real life at the moment. But, fear not, the LibreOffice and Backup articles continue. This month Allan looks at DropBox. Last month we looked at creating a persistent USB stick. This month we take it one step further and create an encrypted USB stick. And if you run a web server you'll want to take a look at our article on Varnish web cache.

We also have a couple of great games being reviewed and a quick article on how to install and run Minecraft. Disclaimer: Full Circle magazine can not be held responsible for the immediate lack of real life interaction which inevitably happens after installing Minecraft. You have been warned! If in doubt, listen to Alan Pope's comments regarding Minecraft in the latest Full Circle Podcast.

And did you hear the news that Canonical have launched Ubuntu TV? It sounds to me like it's an Ubuntu version of XBMC/Boxee to embed into TV's. Check out the news page for more on that. I'm sure you'll all be delighted to know that it looks just like Unity.

I also want to thank all of you who wrote to me after I mentioned that I'd received no letters throughout December 2011. Suffice it to say that I now have enough letters for several months! Thank you all!

All the best, and keep in touch!

Ronnie
